# taffy (machopo's fork)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Upstream | https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy (fetched by URL; no remote) |
| Fork | https://github.com/wusyong/taffy (remote `origin`) |
| Branch | `machopo`, from upstream's `main` at `4aca4f4933` (2026-11-06); the fork's `main` is upstream's, untouched |
| Version | 0.15.0 in `Cargo.toml`: v0.15.1's changes and the unreleased ones after it |
| License | MIT (`LICENSE`) |
| Used by | machopo's `crates/layout` (block, flexbox and grid layout, through taffy's low-level traits on machopo's own box tree), by path |

## Why a fork

machopo follows upstream's main rather than its releases: upstream keeps
fixing what a browser runs into (floats, baselines, `aspect-ratio`), and
waiting for a release left machopo working around them or listing them as
known limitations. A change machopo needs is made here as a commit that can
go upstream as it is; it stays in the fork only until upstream has it, or,
when upstream won't take it, with the reason in the table below.

The branch first started at the tag machopo used from crates.io (`v0.15.0`;
the tag `machopo-2026-11-10` is that branch's tip), so that moving to the
fork changed nothing.

## Local modifications

The commits on `machopo` after upstream's, each a patch in machopo's
`patches/taffy/` (`python3 scripts/ci.py patches taffy` exports them;
`python3 scripts/ci.py third-party` checks that they give this branch):

| Commit | What | Upstream |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add README.machopo.md | This file. Always the last commit, and the only one that changes it, so that the others can go upstream as they are. | Fork only |

Changes are marked with `machopo:` comments. A change meant for upstream
keeps taffy's `rust-version` (1.71), checked with that toolchain before it
is sent; the fork itself builds with machopo's pinned toolchain (taffy pins
none). Anything sent upstream is drafted first and reviewed before it goes
out.

## Tests

```sh
cargo test                       # taffy's own, in this checkout
```

and, in machopo, `cargo test -p layout` and the reftests and WPT of what
the change touches.

## Updating

1. Fetch upstream by URL (`git fetch https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy
   main`) and rebase `machopo` onto the new upstream commit, fixing any
   conflicts. Drop the commits upstream now has; keep this file's commit
   last.
2. Update the start and version above, and the table.
3. Push `machopo` (`--force-with-lease`); first tag the old tip
   (`machopo-<date>`) so that machopo's older pins can still be fetched.
4. In machopo: `third_party.toml`'s `rev` and `upstream_rev`, then
   `python3 scripts/ci.py patches taffy`, then `cargo test --workspace`,
   the reftests and WPT. Upstream's API changes show up as build errors in
   `crates/layout`.
